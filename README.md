# RestaurantProject
A project that will help deepend my knowlege and understanding of the .net framework and serve as my introduction to razer pages. I will create a website based around a reastaurant and the various aspects of a website based on a business like this. I hope that this will be used as evidence of my skills to any future employers of my understanding of c#, .net databases etc this will also enable me to practice my use of git in a more regular fashion
